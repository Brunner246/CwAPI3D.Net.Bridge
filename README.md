# CwAPI3D_CSharp

This project serves as a .NET bridge for the C++ API from Cadwork 3D. It leverages the power of C++ CLI (Common Language Infrastructure) to provide a seamless integration between the .NET environment and the Cadwork 3D API. This allows developers to utilize the robust features of cadwork 3D API within their .NET applications.
